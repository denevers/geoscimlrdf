Voids are hosted by a container (e.g. an aquifer), and can contain water bodies. Voids are differentiated from 'porosity' in that porosity is the proportion of void volume to total volume (i.e. container + voids), while voids are the spaces themselves. Their delineation as a distinct entity is necessary, for example, to capture the volume of fractures in an aquifer"@en .

  rdfs:label "Management Area"@en ;
  skos:definition """The GW_ManagementArea class defines properties associated with areas identified for management purposes. These can be delineated by human factors such as policy or regulation concerns, as well as domain (in this case hydrogeologic or hydrologic) concerns. The management area does not necessarily align exactly with the associated hydrogeologic feature boundaries.  
  
A placeholder (stub) to associated  legislative and reference documentation is provided, as a description of the properties of the associated classes is considered out of scope for GroundWaterML2. The INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model 'Legislation References' and 'DocumentCitation' classes, created also to cover EU Directives reporting, provides possible candidates for these end association classes.   
  
The GW_ManagementArea class identifies properties associated with managing a human defined area over real world features, in this case groundwater related features. As such, this class could provide a pattern for a more generic OGC 'trans-domain' feature management class."  
This class is equivalent to Inspire AM:ManagementRestrictionOrRegulationZone."""@en .
